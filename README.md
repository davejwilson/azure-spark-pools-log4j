### Conclusion

* "The log4j vulnerability appears to affect log4j 2, not 1.x.
There was mention that it could affect 1.x when used with JNDI or SMS
handlers, but Spark does neither. (unless anyone can think of something I'm
missing, but never heard or seen that come up at all in 7 years in Spark)" - Posted to dev@spark.apache.org

* Log4J 1.x was end of life from August 5, 2015, advise is to upgrade to Log4J 2

### Possible Actions

* Check the log4j 1.x CVE list and make sure that the usage scenarios do not match the vunerabilities
  * If the usage does not match the scenario, plan to upgrade spark
  * If the usage fits the vunerability scenario, a spark upgrade is needed immediately
* Plan for an upgrade by contacting azure support to:-
  * See when they will be upgrading the version of spark on the spark pools
  * Verify that the new version of spark in the spark pools is secure (void from CVEs)
  * Confirm that your usage of spark will work with the new version
